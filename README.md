# Twenty-Questions-in-Java

**A Java implementation of the popular guessing game Twenty Questions.**

I wrote this code and associated documentation as a project for the introductory Java programming class I TA'd last semester.

This repository is split into two main folders:

- **starter code**: contains a partially completed version of my solution, which we gave to students as a starting point.
- **solution**: contains my solution, which we used as a baseline for grading.

The associated documentation is located in the "twenty_questions" folder.

*(Disclaimer: I did get the professor's permission to release this project online. They either rewrite, or have their TA's rewrite the projects every semester).*
